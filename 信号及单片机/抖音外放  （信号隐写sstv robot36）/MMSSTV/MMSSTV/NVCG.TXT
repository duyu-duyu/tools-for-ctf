 Only one QSO with the same station is counted toward the score regardless the operating band.
The multiplier is the total number of prefixes worked excluding the same prefix as yours.
The total score=total points x the multiplier.

i.e. W5ZR had QSOs with JA6AP(NVCG member, 2 points)on 10 m and 15m(only one QSO counted), with W5ABC(1 point)on 10m and 20m, and with K5XYZ (1 point)on 40m.  The applicable prefixes are two, JA6 and K5.  W5 is not counted due to the same prefix.
The total score =4 points x 2 prefixes=8

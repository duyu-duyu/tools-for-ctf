MMSSTV FSKID

[Code composition]

The FSKID used in MMSSTV is sent by using 45.45 baudot FSK.  One symbol is composed of 6 bits (B5-B0).

	1500Hz	300ms	(1900Hz in a narrow mode)
	2100Hz	100ms
	1900Hz	22ms	start bit
	B5	22ms	(1=1900Hz, 0=2100Hz)
	B4	22ms		:
	B3	22ms		:
	B2	22ms
	B1	22ms
	B0	22ms
	B5	22ms
	:
	B0	22ms
	B5	22ms

[Call sign]

	$2A C1 C2 ... CN $01 XSUM
		XSUM = C1 xor C2 xor ... xor CN
	
	C1 to CN are modified ASCII code. Code symbols $20 to $5F are represented by $00 to $3F in Cx (x = 1 to N).

[Contest number (3 digits or 4 digits and less than 4096)]
Following the call sign, MMSSTV sends the contest number as follows:

	$02 HH LL XSUM
		HH = Upper 6 bits of the number
		LL = Lower 6 bits of the number
		XSUM = $02 xor HH xor LL

[Contest number (any string)]
Following the call sign, MMSSTV sends the contest number as follows:

	S1 S2 ... SN $01 XSUM
		XSUM = S1 xor S2 xor ... xor SN
Si (i = 1 to N) is ASCII code minus $20. The original code symbols $30 to $5F are represented by $10 to $3F. 

[Notice]
You can freely use the MMSSTV compatible FSKID in your program. You do not have to notify me in any case.

* This document was written based on the logging utility of MMTTY.


----------
MMSSTV logging utility
----------

MMSSTV logging utility offers only limited functions, such as the call sign 
search.

The current log file is the file that was most recently opened by MMSSTV.  
The name of the current log file is displayed at the MMSSTV title bar.  The 
extension of the file name is "MDT."

To change the current log file, select "Open log file" in the File menu.  
Most common file name would be your_call_sign.mdt.


----------
Basic operations
----------

1) Input his/her callsign in the Call box of the log panel.
2) Push the Find button to see if you have made QSO before.
3) Call him/her.  If he/she replies to you, push the QSO button.  At this 
timing, MMSSTV records the starting time in the log.
4) During the QSO, input other information in other boxes, such as his/her 
RST, my RST, and QTH.  You can input more information by pushing the Data 
button.
5) After the QSO is completed, push the QSO button again.  MMSSTV records 
the ending time in the log.


QSO data editing window

During the QSO, push the Data button to open the data editing window.  The 
title bar at the top of the window has:
[Searched callsign]	Entity/Continent	Local_time	QTH.

At the bottom half of the window, the search results are shown.

For the JA stations, you can push the JCC/JCG button (or F7 key) and open 
the JCC/JCG/AJA selection window.  You can incrementally input the QTH in 
Rome-ji.

The search results are shown in four different colors:
Gray:	the callsign being input
Red:	perfect match
Green:	callsign match
Black:	partial match

[Example]
Search by KH0/JI3IVL
	KH0/JI3IVL	Red
	KH0/JI3IVL/P	Green
	JI3IVL		Green
	JI3IVL/3	Green
Search by IVL
	KH0/JI3IVL	Black
	JI3IVL		Black
	JI3IVL/3	Black


Log list

The log list can be shown by pushing the List button.  If you want to update 
the data, double click the target row or hit the return key to open the QSO 
data editing window.

The QSO data list window has the following functions:

[File menu]

- Open log file
It is the same as "Open log file" in the File menu of the main window.  Use 
this function to change the log file.

- Save data now
It is the same as "Save data now" in the File menu of the main window.  
MMSSTV writes the data to the log file, closes the log file, and reopens the 
log file.  It is used to keep the disk updated so as not to lose the log 
data in case, for instance, power outage.

- Make index
It rebuilds the callsign index.  Under normal operations, it is not likely 
to break the index.  However, if you cannot search the callsign, try this 
function.

- Load MMLOG TextFile
It reloads the log data in MMLOG text format into the log (comment by 
JA7UDE, MMLOG is a logging utility also made by Mori san).

- Save selected range to MMLOG TextFile
It saves the selected range to the file in MMLOG text format.

* Use Shift + Up_arrow_key or Shift + Down_arrow_key to select the rows.

- Import
MMSSTV can import the log data in the following formats:
	Text
	ADIF
	LOG200	(L2)
	Turbo HAMLOG (DBS, DBR)
(Comment by JA7UDE, LOG200 and Turbo HAMLOG are Japanese logging programs; 
there are no English version as of April 08, 2001)

- Export selected range
MMSSTV can export the selected data in the following formats:
	Text
	ADIF
	LOG200 (L2)
	Turbo HAMLOG (DBS, DBR)

- Return to MMSSTV
It closes the log list window and returns to the MMSSTV main manu.


[Edit menu]

- Cut
Copy the row to the clipboard and delete it from the log.

- Insert
Insert a row and paste the content of the clipboard to it.

- Select all
Select all the log entries.

- Delete selected range
Delete the selected rows.

- Sort (Date/Time)
Sort the selected rows in Date/Time order.

[Find menu]

- Move top
Move the cursor to the top of the list.

- Move last
Move the cursor to the bottom of the list.

- Search forward
Search the callsign forward

- Search backward
Search the callsign backward

- Search forward again
Search the callsign forward again

- Search backward again
Search the callsign backward again


----------
Contest operation
----------

I have experimentally had the contest functions built into MMSSTV, but I am 
not sure we have SSTV contests.

- Preparation
Open a new file with a unique file name for each contest.
Push Option and select Setup logging.
Choose the RSV contest number format.

595	%N macro gives the same contest number.  If you need another number than 
595, put it in the HisRSV field of the very first data.  For example, put 
5952509 in the first HisRSV field manually.

595+001	%N macro gives the RSV followed by the serial number.  You must put 
the initial value (595001) in the HisRSV field of the very first data.  
MMSSTV automatically increments the serial number after it has made a QSO.


----------
Export log to the text file
----------

You can export the log to a text file.  Push File and select Export selected 
range.  MMSSTV supports three formats for the text file.

	Comma separated text file (CSV)
	Tab separated text file
	Plain text file

MMSSTV has a translation facility of the data fields.  The translation 
macros supported are as follows:

%NULL		No translation is made.
%EOD		All the macros after this macro are ignored.
%YYYY-MM-DD	Date in 2000-07-10 format
%YY-MM-DD	Date in 00-07-10 format
%YYYY/MM/DD	Date in 2000/07/10 format
%YY/MM/DD	Date in 00/07/10 format
%YY		Year in 00 format
%YYYY		Year in 2000 format
%MM		Month in 07 format
%MON		Month in JAN, FEB, MAR format
%MON2		Month in Jan., Feb., Mar. format
%DD		Day in 10 format
%HHMM		Starting time in 1234 format
%HH:MM		Starting time in 12:34 format
%EHHMM		Ending time in 1234 format
%EHH:MM		Ending time in 12:34 format
%CALL		Call sign
%M		Call mark
%MY		MyRST
%HIS		HisRST
%MYRST		MyRST (adjusted its length according to the mode)
%HISRST		HisRST (adjusted its length according to the mode)
%FREQ		Freqency in MHz
%MBAND		Frequency in band
%KHZ		Frequency in KHz
%MODE		Operation mode
%POWER		Power
%NAME		Name
%QTH		QTH
%REM		Remark
%QSL		QSL information
%S		QSL sent mark
%R		QSL received mark
%ENV		Environment variables
%OPT1		Optional field 1
%OPT2		Optional field 2
%USR1		User field 1
%USR2		User field 2

Any other texts are copied "as is."  If you specify Max, the length of each 
row is limited by Max.  If you specify Max=0, the length of each row is not 
limited.

Check UTC if you want to output the date and time in UTC.
Check Double if you want to quote each field with ".

----------
Import from text
----------

MMSSTV can import the log data from a text file.  Push File and select 
Import.  The text file imported to MMSSTV must have one QSO in one row.  
Three formats below are supported:

	Comma separated text (CSV)
	Tab separated text
	Plain text

The translation facility stated in the export section can be used for the 
file import as well.

Check UTC if you want to read the date and time in UTC.  MMSSTV converts 
them in JST.

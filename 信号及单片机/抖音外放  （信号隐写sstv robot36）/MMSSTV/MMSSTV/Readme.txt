To Uninstall MMSSTV:

Should you ever want to remove MMSSTV from your computer.

You can Delete MMSSTV, Using the Windows "Add/Remove Programs" or by clicking on
"Uninstall MMSSTV"  in the windows [Start] Programs menu.

Uninstalling MMSSTV will remove the program, shortcuts and registry entries.
It will leave the MMSSTV folder, with a sub-folder, that were not created by
the install program. Leaving this on your computer will not cause any problems.
If you are short of hard drive space or just what to clean things up, just
delete the MMSSTV folder..

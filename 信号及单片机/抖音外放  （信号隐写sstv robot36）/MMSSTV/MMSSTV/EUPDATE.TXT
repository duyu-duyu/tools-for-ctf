- Added custom log link
- Added custom RadioCommand
- Added custom sound
- Fixed minor bugs and improved several functions.

==============================
Font smoothing
==============================
When the Windows option "Smooth edges of screen fonts" is engaged, the 
background color of the template sometimes leaks at the edges of characters 
on the MMSSTV template window.

There are two ways to solve this problem.
1) Turn the Windows option off.  To do so, you will find the option select 
at:
	Windows XP: Control Panel, System, Advanced, Performance, Visual effects
	Windows 2000: Control Panel, Screen, Effects
	Windows 98: Control Panel, Screen, Effects
2) Change the MMSSTV template option.  Right click on the template window, 
select Options, and check Disable font smoothing.  When this option is 
selected, the font smoothing function of Windows is disabled only within the 
MMSSTV template window.


====================
EXTPTT port
====================
EXTPTT port is provided for the PTT operation using a special USB device, 
which was originally made for FSK keying.  To make use of this port, select 
EXTPTT in the PTT port drop-down list of TX pane of Setup MMSSTV.  
EXTFSK.DLL is prerequisite for the operation.  For more information, refer 
to the following web site.

Revision history Ver1.07 -> Ver1.08
***********************************************************************

- Added notch filter
- Added a function that automatically readjusts the off-synchronized image 
when filters are switched
- Added MSG button in the text & color window
- Changed the number of S.Templates-image pages to 4
- Added dupe check scheme for JASTA contest
- Added LMS filter modes
- Fixed minor bugs and put fine improvements to the program

================
Notch filter
================

I have added an FIR notch filter in RX.  To activate the notch filter, left 
click in the spectrum or waterfall window.  The notch frequency is marked 
with a small triangle.  To deactivate the notch filter, right click anywhere 
in the window.

The notch filter eliminates the beat, but it slightly degrades the image 
quality.  If the notch filter frequency is put closely to the 
synchronization signal, the RX operation sometimes stops for the weak 
signals if auto-stop function is turned on.


  Sound ---> Notch ---> LMS -+-> BPF ---> Demodulator
                             |
                             --> Spectrum display

=============================================
MSG button in the "Text & Color" window
=============================================
In the template window, you can add text by pushing "T" button just under 
the template window.  Double clicking the added text gets the Text & Color 
window popped up.  You can find MSG button at the bottom center of the 
window.  When you push the button, a big square pane appears in the window.  
Input pre-defined text lines in the window.  The text can include macro 
keywords.  Double clicked line is copied to the text box.
For example, input the text lines in the white pane as follows.
	Hello
	Good morning
	Good afternoon
	Good evening
	73
If you double click on 73, the content of the text box becomes 73.



===================================================
Added dupe check scheme for JASTA
===================================================
Click on Option and select Setup logging.  Select MISC tab.  You will find 
JASTA contest in Dupe check pane.  If MMSSTV detects dupe, the color of the 
callsign in the main window changes red.  The dupe conditions are:

Callsign only
	If the same callsign has been found regardless of band or mode

Hit on the same band
	If the same callsign has been found in the same band

JASTA contest
	If the same callsign has been found "in the SSTV mode" and "on the same 
day" and "on 14MHz or upper bands."




=============================
LMS filter selection
=============================
Three LMS filter modes can be selected by right clicking on the LMS button 
in the DSP pane of the main window.

- Noise smoothing:	Conventional (default)
- Auto notch (fast):	Automatic notch filter with fast response
- Auto notch (slow):	Automatic notch filter with slow response

The response of the automatic notch filter is intentionally set slow so as 
not to degrade the image quality.  Even set so, some images will be 
affected.

Revision history Ver1.06 -> Ver1.07
***********************************************************************

- Added multipage for folder thumbnail
- Implemented fast thumbnail browsing
- Added OLE support
- Fixed some bugs and applied minor improvements


======================================
Multipage for folder thumbnail
======================================

The thumbnail window is useful for managing your picture resources.  With 
MMSSTV 1.07, you can view the pictures stored in two or more different 
folders in one thumbnail window.

To open the thumbnail window, click on "View" and select "Always show 
thumbnails of files folder."  Right click on any thumbnail in the thumbnail 
window and select "Options" and "Create new page."  Select the folder that 
you want to add the thumbnail window.  You will find a new tab added at the 
top of the window.  If you want to change the tab name, select "Options" and 
"Rename page."  The window can have up to 10 pages.


==================================
Fast thumbnail browsing
==================================

If the size of the picture or template is large, it should take substantial 
time to load and show all the thumbnail images in the folder thumbnail 
window.  To get the load and show operation faster, MMSSTV version 1.07 
makes an index of the thumbnails once while loaded.  MMSSTV uses the index 
for the next time on for faster thumbnail browsing.

MMSSTV creates the index in the FIndex folder under the MMSSTV directory.  
The index contains the view information and the thumbnail bitmaps.  The 
index uses some disk spaces, but it significantly saves the memory and 
resources.

If you do not want to make the index, right click on the thumbnail, select 
"Options" and uncheck "Fast access with index."  MMSSTV does not make the 
index as version 1.06 or earlier.  You can individually enable or disable 
this indexing feature for each folder.

* MMSSTV does not generate any file in the referred folders.

===============
OLE support
===============

MMSSTV now supports OLE (Object Linking and Embedding).  If the object is 
embedded (or linked) in the template, you can make use of the various 
functions offered in the object.

* Object means the whole or some part of the document in another 
application.

* What kind of object can you utilize in MMSSTV?  It is dependent on the OLE 
application you have.  If you have installed a word processor, for example, 
you can use the word processor document as well as all the functions, such 
as character effect and picture drawing, provided in the word processor.


1. Object embedding

To embed an object in the template, use one of the following five methods.

- Right click on the template window of MMSSTV, select Object -> Insert, and 
make a new object to embed.  You can embed the existing file or place a link 
to it in the template, too.

- Make an object in the other application and copy it to the clip board.  
Right click on the template window of MMSSTV, and select Object -> Paste.

- Drag and drop the target object file from Explorer or My computer to the 
MMSSTV template.  It should be noted, however, that BMP, JPG, WMF, MTM, MTI, 
and DLL files are not embedded as an OLE object.

- Open the folder thumbnail window (View -> Always show thumbnails of files 
folder), and right click on the target picture in the window.  Select "Embed 
to Template as OLE."  In this case, the embedded picture always becomes a 
bitmap OLE.

- Open the thumbnail folder as the OLE object type and double click the 
target thumbnail.  You can use drag&drop, too.

2. Object editing

To edit the embedded object, just double click it.  Another way to do this 
is keep the object selected and push the Set color button.  If you cannot 
start the server application, right click on the target object and select 
Object -> Edit.

The server application of the embedded object works as the editor.  Please 
refer to the help file of the server application.  For example, Windows 
Paint is invoked for the target application when a BMP file is double 
clicked.

3. Object displaying and resizing

MMSSTV displays the object in the overlay mode.  If you do not want to get 
the background transparent, right click on the object, select Object, and 
uncheck Overlay.

When "Object" -> "Stretch as bitmap" is checked, MMSSTV uses a bitmap 
resizing code instead of a metafile resizing code.  Generally speaking, the 
metafile resizing code gives better results for the characters with special 
effect.  The bitmap resizing code, on the other hand, gives better result 
for image objects like photographs.

4. Custom item

If you are not satisfied with the MMSSTV graphic tools or the OLE functions, 
you can embed a custom item that you have created by yourself.

To embed a custom item, go with "Object" -> "Insert custom item," and select 
the target item.  Another way to do this is to open the folder thumbnail as 
Custom item type and double click the target thumbnail (or drag & drop it to 
the template).

For the implementation of the custom item, refer to ECUSTOM.TXT, which is 
included in the PerImg package.

Revision history Ver1.05 -> Ver1.06
***********************************************************************

- Added VFO polling for JRC JST-245
- Supported the slash zero in Hangul font
- Added several SSTV modes
- Improved the automatic synchronization function
- Had the timing of the B/W 8-sec mode adjusted to Robot 1200C
- Added a special font manipulation for East Asian languages
- Added customizable VOX tone
- Took measures not to lost sound
- Added RTS control for muting audio while receiving a picture
- Added overlay function
- Fixed some bugs and applied minor improvements


==========================
Special font manipulation for East Asian languages
==========================

Version 1.05G has a special font manipulation for East Asian languages.  In 
case you want to use a new language that is different from your default one, 
you must install the font and code page of the new one.  If you have only 
the font installed, you might encounter problems in several operations 
including vertical unfolding.

MMSSTV treats the codepages of the following languages in a special manner:

	932	Japanese		Verified
	949	Hangul			Verified
	950	Chinese (BIG5)		Not verified
	936	Chinese (GB2312)	Not verified


======================
Sound lost
======================

I have figured out that some soundcards are likely to lose sound, which 
results in synchronization drift.  I have added a code to try fixing the 
problem.  It is effective in some degree, but does not completely solve the 
problem.  I recommend you to install the latest device driver of your 
soundcard.

If you still have the problem, try turning off LoopBack in the TX page and 
increasing the FIFO depth in the Misc page.


==============
MP/MR/ML modes
==============


MP mode: It is based on the color difference scheme that the PD mode uses.  
This mode should be useful for reducing multi-path distortion and jitter.  
The scan time for each pixel is longer than the other modes, but the color 
information along the vertical axis is compressed.

MR/ML mode: It is based on the color difference scheme that the Robot 24/72 
mode uses.  This mode is aimed for offering good resolution in good condx.  
The color information along the horizontal axis is compressed.

These modes are not new to SSTV actually, but I have added them by way of 
trial.  In particular, I have considered good trade-off between the 
transmission time, picture size, and quality.  As a new trial, the VIS 
signal is expanded to 16 bits.  Refer to Mode.txt for the details of the new 
modes and their VIS format.



================
B/W 8-sec mode
================

Changing with times including the old monochrome generation, the B/W 8-sec 
mode seems to have several "dialects" in terms of the aspect ratio and the 
timing.
MMSSTV has adjusted the timing to the Robot 1200C scan converter, which is 
used as the standard of the VIS signals.  When you come across a picture 
with different timing, turn Auto slant on or push the niconico mark button 
in the Sync window.



================
RTS control while scan
================

I have added "RTS while scan" option in the MMSSTV Setup window.  The 
behavior of the COM port signals, that is, DTR, RTS, and TXD can be selected 
as follows:

[RTS while scan = OFF]
		RX	TX	SCAN (receiving a picture)
	DTR	OFF	ON	OFF
	RTS	OFF	ON	OFF
	TXD	---	---	--- (no control)

[RTS while scan = ON]
		RX	TX	SCAN (receiving a picture)
	DTR	OFF	ON	OFF
	RTS	OFF	ON	ON
	TXD	NoBreak	NoBreak	Break


==========
VOX tone
==========

If you use the COM port to switch PTT or if you have a responsive VOX 
interface, you can eliminate the VOX tone, which is sent before the picture. 
  Select "User defined" in the VOX tone pane on the TX page of Setup MMSSTV. 
  Push Edit button and delete all the definitions.  MMSSTV no longer 
generates the tone for triggering VOX prior to sending a picture.


==============
Overlay (superimpose) function
==============

In the template, you can place an image that is superimposed on the TX 
picture.  By using an image that has a uniform background color, such as an 
illustration, you would be able to make amusing effects on your picture.

In the image, all the pixels that have the transparent color are 
transparent, that is, invisible on the TX picture.  The transparent color is 
defined by the color of the transparent point in the image.  The default 
position of the transparent point is the upper left corner of the image.

Here is a sample procedure to use the overlay function.  In the template 
window, push Draw picture button (a small button whose face has the sun and 
mountains), and draw a rectangle that specifies the image size and position 
in the template window.  You should have the Choose picture window popped 
up.  Select Overlay in the source pane, and load an image.  Left click on 
somewhere in the picture.  The clicked point is the new transparent point, 
that is, the color of the point becomes the new transparent color.   Try 
right clicking somewhere in the image.  All the pixels that have the same 
color of the clicked point are changed to the current transparent color.

If the source image is stored in the JPEG format, the background color is 
not always uniform owing to the image compression effect.  This results in 
color leak in the overlay image.  In such a case, try using the color 
smoothing function, which is available at the right side of the Choose 
picture window, in order to alleviate the color leak.

When the size of the overlay image is changed in the template window, MMSSTV 
gives priority to the color smoothness over the image quality.  If the image 
quality is degraded, change the size of the image in the bitmap format, and 
then convert it to the overlay image.  The size change in the bitmap format, 
however, gives priority to the image quality, and thus it would degrade the 
color smoothness.  In this case, try using the color smoothing function to 
alleviate the color leak.




***********************************************************************
Revision history Ver1.04 -> Ver1.05
***********************************************************************
- Added two window layouts
- Added an optional window for the control buttons
- Added an option that attaches the RX window to the WINDOWS desktop.
- Added double-click short-cut operations for the stocked pictures, stocked 
templates, folder thumbnails.
- Added 320x240 image manipulating schemes
- Added a repeater function
- Fixed a bug that caused the resource shortage in Windows 95/98/ME
- Fixed some bugs and applied minor improvements


============
Window layouts
============
You can select one of three window layouts by clicking "View" and selecting 
"Design."

[Standard]
  This is the conventional MMSSTV window layout.  All the information is 
shown in one window.

[Separate stock view]
  The stock window is detached from the main window.

[Separate all views]
  All the windows are separated.

Each detached window can be moved and resized independently.


====================
Control buttons window

====================
  Click on "View" and select "Always show control buttons" to open an 
optional window dedicated to the control buttons.

[Stop RX]
  Stop the RX operation immediately and go into the stand-by state (Auto).

[ReSync]
  Make the synchronization again.

[Lock RX]
  When the button is depressed, MMSSTV turns off "Auto stop" and "Auto 
restart," and therefore it won't stop the RX scan even in QRM and/or QSB.  
When the button is not depressed, "Auto stop" and "Auto restart" are 
resumed.

[CopyHist]
  If the RX image is not copied to the history, press this button to force 
the copy.

[TX(F9)]
  It functions just same as the TX button of the TX window.  You can use F9 
key to switch TX/RX.


==============================================
Attaching the RX window to the WINDOWS desktop
==============================================
  When you have activated "Always show RX viewer" option, you can attach the 
window to the WINDOWS desktop.  Right click the RX window and select "Child 
of a desktop window" in the pop-up menu.
  In this mode, the RX viewer remains active, even if the main MMSSTV window 
is minimized.


=========================
320x240 image manipulation
=========================
  Click on "Edit" and select "Handling of 320x240" to settle how to 
manipulate 320x240 image sources.  This selection is also applied to the 
combination of the 640x480 source and 640x496 TX images.

[Vertical stretching]
@The image is vertically stretched.  The image aspect ratio is not 
reserved.

[Auto stretching]
  The image is horizontally and vertically stretched. The aspect ratio is 
reserved.  The original image slightly loses the left and right edges.  This 
is the operation that MMSSTV used in the earlier versions.

[No stretching]
  The image size is unchanged.  The TX image has 16 vacant lines at the 
bottom.

[Shift picture for the header]
  The image size is unchanged.  The TX image has 16 vacant lines at the top 
for the header.

  It should be noted that this manipulation does not work for the image that 
derived through the image clipper.


================
SSTV repeater function
================
  MMSSTV can work as an SSTV repeater.  Refer to Repeater.txt for details.


***********************************************************************
Revision history Ver1.03 -> Ver1.04
***********************************************************************
- Improved the user interface for the character input in the template
- Added perspective and 3-D effects for the template text
- Corrected some bugs and applied minor improvements

***********************************************************************
Revision history Ver1.02 -> Ver1.03
***********************************************************************
- Added "FFT demodulator" mode in the spectrum display
- Added AFC
- Added Undo in the pop-up menu for the template
- Corrected some bugs and applied minor improvements

================
Spectrum display
================
The user can select one of "OFF," "FFT," or "FM demodulator" mode for the 
spectrum display.  The default has been set to FM demodulator.  If you want 
to use the conventional FFT mode, change back it to "FFT."

* If you draw CMT-HELL, which was made by PY4ZBZ, in the waterfall of 
MMSSTV, you must select "FFT."

The FM demodulator uses another wide-band FM demodulator in addition to the 
picture demodulator.  It draws the chart as the function of the rate of 
incidence at each frequency.  Because its computation process is much 
simpler than the FFT, it gives good response even to the short pulse like a 
synchronization signal, but it does not reflect the signal level.

The FFT and FM demodulator observe the signal before the SSTV BPF in order 
to see the signals outside of the BPF, too.

   --- Sound in --+--> SSTV demodulator
                  |
                  ---> Spectral (FFT / FM demodulator)


==============
AFC
==============
AFC is activated by pushing the AFC button in the DSP pane on the main 
window.  The default is ON.
When AFC is locked to the signal, the triangle marker on the synchronization 
frequency line is displayed in blue.  When AFC is unlocked, the triangle 
marker is displayed in red.  During in red, the response to the frequency 
discrimination becomes slow.

* The AGC in the previous versions was deleted because it seemed to offer no 
improvements.


***********************************************************************
Revision history: Ver1.01 -> Ver1.02
***********************************************************************
- Added the Hilbert transform method in the FM decoder
- Improved the processing speed of the low-level sound processing
- Added the TX-offset button on the Sync window
- Added High-accuracy slant adjustment method
- Added Vari-SSTV function
- Debugged the automatic start function
- Corrected some bugs and enhanced some functions


==================================
Added Hilbert transform method in the FM decoder
==================================
The figure below shows the flow of the Hilbert transform decoder.  This idea 
was given by JA6UHL Nishimura-san (MNI TNX to JA6UHL).

  --+> Delay(N) -> Real
    |                |==> ATAN --> Differentiator --> LPF --> Pic. data
    --> FIR(2N) --> Image


========================
Low-level sound buffer
========================
I enhanced the sound buffer processing.  You can set the FIFO sizes for TX 
and RX in the option menu.
If you often loose the sound, that is, loose the synchronization, try 
enlarging the RX FIFO or TX FIFO.  Giving higher priority to the sound 
processing is another way of alleviate the sound loosing.


==============
High-accuracy slant adjustment
==============
MMSSTV uses the least square method to solve the linear equation for 
analyzing the synchronization timings.  For high quality RX signals, it will 
give the error less than 2ppm.
To start the high-accuracy slant adjustment, push the NikoNiko button 
(comment by JA7UDE: the smiley button).  You also can start it by right 
clicking on the sync or RX window and selecting High-accuracy slant 
adjustment in the pop-up menu.  It should be noted that you must have 
received at least 16 scan lines to make this adjustment operational.  The 
more the scan lines, the better the accuracy.


===============
Adjustment of TX offset
===============
Assuming that you have the RX clock calibrated, MMSSTV transmits the signal 
and receives it through the external loop back.
After you have adjusted the slant (push the NikoNiko smiley button), push 
the TX button in the Sync window.  MMSSTV automatically records the TX 
offset frequency.


========
VariSSTV
========
VariSSTV, which is proposed by Mr. Samuel Hunt, is a method to protect the 
final device of the TX.  He says that different colors have different 
brightness and therefore making the power lower in the way shown below gives 
better noise immunity.

Sync signal	100%
Red		29.8%
Green		58.8%
Blue		11%

For details, visit http://www.supersam.co.uk/sstvpwer.htm.

I have no idea how it is effective.  Please give it a try by yourself.  Go 
Option, Setup MMSSTV, TX tab, and check the VariSSTV box under the digital 
output level slider.  This is not operational in Robot36 or Robot72.

================
New SSTV modes
================

The following SSTV modes have been added.

	Name		Time(s)	Size			Method
	---------------------------------------------------
	SC2-120		122		320x256		RGB
	SC2-60		62		320x256		RGB
	PD50		50		320x256		Color discrimination
	PD90		90		320x256		Color discrimination
	PD120		126		640x496		Color discrimination
	PD160		161		512x400		Color discrimination
	PD180		187		640x496		Color discrimination
	PD240		248		640x496		Color discrimination
	PD290		289		800x616		Color discrimination
	P3		203		640x496		RGB
	P5		305		640x496		RGB
	P7		406		640x496		RGB

To use one of these modes, click the mode button in TX or RX window with the 
right button of the mouse and select it from the pop-up menu.

PD120 - PD290 and P3 - P5 have bigger image sizes than 320 x 256 (from now 
on, I call them high-resolution modes).  The image view board of the MMSSTV 
main window is designed to show a 320x256 image.  For this reason, MMSSTV 
shrinks and displays the images (resized to 320x256) in those 
high-resolution modes.  In other words, the sizes of the actual image and 
that displayed in the RX window would not be the same.

To view the high-resolution images in the original size, push the magnifier 
button under the RX or History window, or at the Always Show RX viewer, 
right click and select Resize to RX size in the pop up menu.

To view the high-resolution TX images in the original size, push the 
magnifier button under the TX window.

If the sizes in the TX mode and in the original image are different, MMSSTV 
does not resize the original image.  If you want to resize the image, right 
click the TX window and select 'Stretch TX image by different size' in the 
pop-up menu.  In this case, however, the image resolution sometimes 
degrades, particularly when you get it bigger.  In addition, bear in mind 
that different modes have different aspect ratios.

Anyhow, it is recommended that you reload the image into the TX window if 
you use images in different sizes.

MMSSTV templates, therefore, have several sizes.  It is a good idea to use 
the template whose size is the same as the image.  In default, MMSSTV tries 
to get the template size to fit the image.  However, the layout of the 
template components is not reserved.


You can resize the template size by selecting Size entry in the pop-up menu, 
which appears by right clicking the Template window.  If the size of the 
template is different from that of the image, MMSSTV resizes the template 
and gets it superimposed to the image.  It should be noted that the quality 
of the template would get worse, but you can continue to use the templates 
that you designed in different sizes.

The image size in the Stocked pictures is predefined as 320x256.  If you 
want to change it, right click the Stocked pictures area and select Size in 
the pop-up menu.

When you drag & drop an image from the TX window to the Stocked pictures 
window, MMSSTV uses the TX image size.

In PD290, P5, and P7 modes, the RAM, which is used for the automatic slant 
adjustment, cannot store the whole image data.  The slant and phase 
adjustment can be applied only to some portion of the data.  To avoid this 
problem, select FILE for the RX buffer.


========================
New functions in the image clipper
========================

The following new functions have been added.

- Copy and paste without changing the original image size
- Rotate the image in 90 degrees
- Adjust the image
- Copy to the clipboard

- Save an image to a file

To use these functions, right click the image clipper window.  You will get 
the pop-up menu for the functions.


================================
Preview in file selection
================================

In the dialog box for loading an image file, you can preview the image by 
clicking the file name.
The preview window is appeared at the top left corner for the first time, 
but you can change the size and position as you like.
